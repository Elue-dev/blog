        <h1>Vaccination vs Immunization</h1>
        <p align = "center"> Vaccination and Immunization have been used interchangeably by many, but they dont exactly mean 
            the same thing.

            Vaccination is the process while Immunization is the result or end product or the effect on the body.
             Vaccination is when a vaccine is admistered to animals or humans by injection which then gives the 
             animal or human immunity against a disease while immunization is what happens in the body after you
              have been vaccinated, i.e the process by which one becomes immunized against the disease.
            
            It is important to note that not only vaccines cause immunization, a disease can also cause immunization
             in the sense that, after the animals or humans comes down with the disease and then it recovers, 
             if the disease comes on the animal or human again, the body  would readily attack the disease because 
             it has been exposed to it before. [Note that the animal or human came down with illness when it was
              a disease and not a vaccine involved in the immunization process]. This is also what a vaccine does,
               with the exception being that when a vaccine is used, the animal or human dosent come down with 
               illness unlike when it was a disease that triggered the immunization. The vaccine just imitates the 
               action of a disease causing agent.
            
            Also, the two terms have a similarity in that they both refer to a condition in which the body is made
             indifferent against a disease,the difference lies in how one aquires this indifference. 
            
            So, the two terms are not to be used interchangeably,and i hope we now know the difference between the two.
