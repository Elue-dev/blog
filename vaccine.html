        <h1 class="vaccine">Vaccination and its importance.  </h1>
        <p align="center" class="pvac">Firstly, a Vaccine is a biological preparation that is given to animals
             and humans to stimulate
             the production of antibodies by the body and provide immunity against a disease.
              The vaccine is usually prepared from the agent that causes the disease or the synthetic
               substitute of the agent.
            After this stimulation, the body becomes sensitized to such an agent or antigen, so if the body
             is being exposed to the antigen again, it readily produces antibodies against it because it has been
              exposed to it before, thanks to the vaccine. If the antigen attacks a naive animal or human
               [meaning they havent been sensitized], they may not readily produce antibodies compared to if their
                immune system has been sensitized by a vaccine, and so can come down with an ailment.
            
            Lets look at this analogy for proper understanding, Take for instance a police man  wants to go
             on a rescue mission but he heard from the previously caught thieves from the Gang that the previous
               police man who went was shot dead by the Gang, this police can go to put on a bullet proof jacket,
                so when he goes on the mission, he wont be affected by the shots of bullet, Why?  Because he has been 
                warned of the danger or “sensitized”,so, lets see the previously caught thieves from the gang as the
                 Vaccine, as they were the ones that informed the police of the danger than can occur from the Gang,
                  lets see the Gang as the Antigen. I hope this helps. 
            
            <p class="bold"> <b>What is this “Antigen”??</b></p>
            
            <p align= "center">The Antigen is a foreign substance, which induces an immune response, [especially the production 
            of antibodies]. Immune response is the response by the <br>body when it is exposed to a foreign or strange 
            agent, i.e an agent which is not normally found in the body, so it tries to attack it, think about how
             a dog <br>would react when he sees an unknown person, he attacks because he dosent know who the person is, 
             that is exactly how the body reacts to an Antigen (foreign substance). The antigen could be  bacteria,
              virus, toxins and ther foreign substances. So, an Antigen stimulates the body to respond by producing
               antibodies against it. </p>
            
           <p class="bold"> <b>What is an antibody?</b></p>
             <p align = "center">An antibody is a protein, produced by plasma cells that is being used by the immune system to 
             counteract or neutralize antigens (bacteria, viruses etc). <br>
            So, vaccination is a stimulant of the Immune System which is the body’s defence system against
             foreign agents that cause a disease,<br>i.e a system that enables the body produce an immune response. </p>
            
            <p align = "center">So, vaccination is like a prophylactic treatment that prevents future infections. This is why
             vaccination is extremely important in humans and animals,<br> it prepares the body for a disease,
              prepares the body against an agent or antigen by given it a vaccine and this vaccine is made
               from the agent<br> or antigen(that causes the disease)  or if not, very similr to it. Without 
               this vaccination, the body would not respond maximally to the antigen that causes the disease
                because it has not been exposed to it before. Vaccination is a stimulant for the Immune System. 
            Check the analogy given above for proper understanding. 
            Note these key words: Vaccine, Antigen, Antibody, Immune system, Immune response, Sensitization,
            Prophylactic treatment.
